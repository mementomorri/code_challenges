"""
A swap is defined as taking two distinct positions in an array and swapping the values in them.

A circular array is defined as an array where we consider the first element and the last element to be adjacent.

Given a binary circular array nums, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1's present in the array together at any location.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
[0,0,1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0,0,0] using 1 swap.
[1,1,0,0,0,0,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] using 2 swaps.
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 or 1 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 2.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,0,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All the 1's are already grouped together due to the circular property of the array.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 0.



Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
