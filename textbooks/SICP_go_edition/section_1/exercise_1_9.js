// exercise 1.1.9
//
// First function is recursive and so is the process.
// We call function `plus` recursively and keep on stacking
// incremention of result.
//
// Second function is recursive, but process is iterative.
// We increment variables first, and then make tail-recirsive call,
// which makes it iterative.
