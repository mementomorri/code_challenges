Let us denote the maximal error of an interval with center i by Δi
the maximal error of an interval with center j by Δj,
and the maximal error of the multiplication result with center k by Δk.
Then:

k+Δk=(i+Δi)∗(j+Δj)=ij+jΔi+iΔj+ΔiΔj

Since k=ij

Δk=jΔi+iΔj+ΔiΔj

Since we assume that Δi≪ i and Δj≪ j, we can neglect the term ΔiΔj and obtain

Δk=jΔi+iΔj

Expressed in tolerances, we obtain:

Δk/k=(jΔi+iΔj)/ij=Δi/i+Δj/j

Thus, the tolerance of the result of an interval multiplication
is (roughly) the sum of the tolerances of its arguments.
