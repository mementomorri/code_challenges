A universally exact, algebraically consistent interval‑arithmetic package is theoretically impossible because guaranteeing enclosure while eliminating all rounding‑induced widening would require exact real‑number computation, which cannot be achieved with finite representation. However, by employing directed rounding, smarter expression handling, and more sophisticated models like affine arithmetic, one can significantly reduce the differences between equivalent forms, making the shortcoming much less pronounced in practice.
